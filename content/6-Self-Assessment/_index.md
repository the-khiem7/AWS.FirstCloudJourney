During my internship at **First Cloud Journey**, I was not only learning AWS services but also actively building real architectures, deploying infrastructure, debugging complex issues, and leading the technical direction of the team.  
This experience shaped the way I analyze systems, approach problems, and deliver solutions with clarity and structure.

I contributed heavily to:

- Designing cloud architecture (AWS + LocalStack + Terraform)  
- Implementing Amplify, CloudFront, S3, Cognito, IAM, VPC  
- Deploying PostgreSQL on EC2 and integrating with the web  
- Writing high-quality documentation: Worklog, Proposal, Workshop  
- Troubleshooting, optimizing, restructuring core parts of the project  
- Guiding teammates through unclear or technically challenging areas

### Working style  
I focus on **understanding deeply**, **building solid foundations**, and **organizing everything into a clean, systematic workflow**.  
Even with shifting requirements and technical obstacles, I remained consistent and solution-oriented.

Below is my personal evaluation:

## Strengths
- Fast, independent learner capable of mastering complex AWS topics.  
- Strong architectural thinking and system-level reasoning.  
- Key contributor in technical decision-making.  
- Excellent documentation and structuring of project materials.  
- Effective problem solver, especially under ambiguity.

## Areas for improvement
- Strengthen consistency in time management during high workload weeks.  
- Improve communication balance for non-technical audiences.  
- Break down tasks more effectively rather than taking on too many critical roles.

## Final Reflection
This internship was not just an introduction to AWS—it was a transformation in how I build, reason, and deliver technology.  
I am confident that the mindset and skills developed here will serve as a strong foundation for my next steps in cloud engineering and system architecture.
