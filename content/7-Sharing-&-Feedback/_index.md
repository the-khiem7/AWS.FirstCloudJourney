# SHARING AND FEEDBACK

Below is my personal reflection on the First Cloud Journey program, written in a way that represents my real working style, learning approach, and technical growth.

---

## Overall Evaluation

### 1. Working Environment
The environment at FCJ is friendly, supportive, and comfortable.  
People are always willing to help — not only during class hours, but also when the project runs into technical issues.

One thing I would appreciate is more technical bonding sessions or small workshops to strengthen team connection and share deeper cloud knowledge.

---

### 2. Support from Mentor & Admin
What I valued most is that the mentor did not give me direct answers — instead, he guided me to think, analyze, and find the solution myself.  
This aligns very well with my learning style.

The admin team structured everything cleanly, making it easy to stay organized and focus on the technical components.

---

### 3. Relevance to My Major
Everything I worked on is closely related to cloud engineering, system architecture, and backend development.  
The experience helped me bridge the gap between **school theory** and **real-world cloud deployment**.

---

### 4. Learning & Skill Development
I strengthened many practical skills:

- Cloud architecture  
- Terraform & automation  
- Local AWS simulation (LocalStack Pro)  
- Debugging & system analysis  
- Technical documentation  

FCJ encourages exploration rather than following a rigid syllabus, which helped me grow faster.

---

### 5. Team Culture & Spirit
The team is collaborative, respectful, and open-minded.  
I appreciate how everyone supports new ideas — especially when I wanted to experiment with Terraform, LocalStack, or new architecture models.

---

### 6. Internship Policies / Benefits
The flexibility in working hours and availability of resources (tools, guidance, discussions) is a huge advantage.  
The program provided a strong sandbox environment to explore AWS deeply.

---

## Additional Questions

### • What did you enjoy the most?
Building a fully functional cloud architecture from scratch — both locally and on AWS.

### • What should the program improve?
- More deep-dive technical sessions  
- More hands-on labs for specific topics  

### • Would you recommend this internship?
Yes. Especially to people who want **real cloud experience**, not just certification-level theory.

---

## Suggestions & Expectations
- Add advanced topics: observability, cost optimization, CI/CD pipelines  
- I would love to continue participating in future FCJ activities or real projects  
- Maintain the practical, experiment-driven learning style — it is the strongest part of the program
