## Key Highlights

### Opening & Community Direction
- Opening remarks on vision, objectives, and welcome; coffee networking to connect builders and share AWS learning paths.

### Enterprise Chatbot: Unlocking Context with MCP on AWS
- Building an enterprise chatbot with advanced context handling.
- MCP concept: safer access/control/use of context.
- AWS implementation with live demo and production readiness lessons.

### GenAI Kitchen Recipe Recommendation System
- Personalized recipe recommendations using GenAI.
- Workflow design on AWS linking data + recommendation logic + user experience.
- Demo plus discussion on improving personalization.

### Internal Chatbot with RAG on AWS Serverless
- RAG approach: retrieve relevant knowledge then generate accurate answers.
- Building an internal FAQ/knowledge chatbot with a fully serverless AWS stack.
- Practical enterprise/internal use cases (policy, onboarding, operations).

### GenAI Multi-Agent Systems for Process Automation
- Multi-agent architecture: specialized roles (planner/worker/tool-user).
- Serverless orchestration for reliable process automation.
- Banking scenarios: repetitive workflow automation and approvals.

### GenAI with Kiro IDE & Strands Agent
- Turning ideas into working prototypes quickly for production and R&D.
- Workflow-orchestration mindset for multi-step GenAI tasks.
- Multi-agent demo showing productivity gains from tooling.

## Key Takeaways

### Design Mindset
- Start from the audience/problem (enterprise vs academic vs banking) before picking tools.
- Prioritize practical demos and lessons learned to shorten the build–test–iterate loop.
- Share patterns, reusable blocks, and trade-offs openly within the community.

### Technical Architecture
- RAG suits internal knowledge/FAQ chatbots with large, changing content.
- Serverless helps ship GenAI prototypes faster with lower operational overhead.
- Multi-agent fits process automation when tasks can be decomposed into roles/steps/tool-calls.
- Workflow orchestration is critical for reliable multi-stage GenAI systems.

### Applying to Work
- Pilot a small internal RAG chatbot for docs/FAQs; measure usefulness and maintenance effort.
- Prototype a multi-agent workflow for automation (triage, reporting, operations).
- Capture lessons from demos into reusable templates (architecture checklist, prompts, observability, cost).
- Host internal sharing sessions to spread common language and best practices.

## Event Experience
This community day highlighted real-world GenAI builds on AWS across industries. Live demos, architecture deep dives, and networking provided actionable patterns for serverless RAG chatbots, multi-agent automation, and workflow design—valuable for planning practical GenAI initiatives.
