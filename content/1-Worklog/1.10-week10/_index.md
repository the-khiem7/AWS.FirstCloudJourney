## Week 10 Achievements

### 1. Strengthened and finalized system architecture
- Architecture reached version 9, improved with CloudFront, Amplify, Supabase, and PostgreSQL.  
- System flow is clearer and aligns well with a modern serverless model.  
- Ensures consistency for future AWS deployment.

### 2. Improved development workflow with LocalStack and Docker
- LocalStack BASE selected for full Cognito support.  
- Docker introduced for consistent local environments across team members.  
- Local simulation significantly reduces development time and AWS deployment risk.

### 3. Website refinement and database migration to Supabase
- Migrated from previous DB to Supabase for easier development and better performance.  
- Updated website logic ensures stable integration with the new backend.  
- Establishes a strong foundation for user behavior analytics later.

### 4. Standardized documentation workflow
- Vietnamese documentation revised for clarity and structure.  
- Forms the basis for English documentation required for workshops or official reports.  
- Improves team alignment and long-term maintainability.

### 5. Created document template and Hugo integration
- Initial version of the docx template completed for publication on Hugo.  
- Provides a standardized layout for team deliverables.  
- Will continue to be refined in upcoming weeks.

### 6. Clear assignment of documentation responsibilities
- Each member assigned specific sections of the document.  
- Ensures parallel work and faster completion.  
- Reduces duplication and improves overall content quality.

## Week 10 Summary
Week 10 focused on stabilizing architecture, refining documentation, strengthening local development tools, and preparing the team for the next phase: AWS real deployment.  
The progress made this week sets a strong foundation for Weeks 11 and 12.
