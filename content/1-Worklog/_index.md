# Worklog Overview  
This section provides a complete record of my 12-week learning and project development journey.  
Throughout the internship period, I followed a structured weekly plan that combined:

- Studying AWS cloud services and architectures  
- Hands-on implementation with real AWS environments and LocalStack  
- Building and improving an e-commerce web application  
- Practicing DevOps workflows with Terraform, Amplify, CloudFront, S3, Cognito  
- Team collaboration, technical discussions, and documentation  

Each weekly worklog describes **what was done**, **why it was done**, and **what outcomes were achieved**, forming a clear narrative of progress from Week 1 to Week 12.

The full worklog spans approximately 3 months, aligning with the standard internship duration.
