## Week 2 Objectives:
- Build a strong foundation in **AWS VPC** and core networking concepts.  
- Understand VPC security mechanisms: **Security Groups**, **Network ACLs**, routing, subnets, IGW, and NAT.  
- Explore hybrid networking architectures such as **VPN**, **DirectConnect**, and **Route 53 Resolver**.  
- Complete end-to-end VPC labs: VPC creation, routing setup, EC2 networking, DNS resolver, VPC peering, and Transit Gateway.  
- Strengthen hands-on networking skills required for advanced AWS modules.

## Week 2 Achievements:
- Developed strong understanding of AWS networking fundamentals and VPC design.  
- Gained hands-on experience with IGW, NAT Gateway, route tables, subnets, and network segmentation.  
- Clearly understood the difference between **stateful Security Groups** and **stateless Network ACLs**.  
- Successfully configured Hybrid DNS with Route 53 Resolver (Outbound, Inbound, DNS Rules).  
- Completed full workflows for **VPC Peering** and **Transit Gateway**.  
- Built confidence in designing small-to-medium AWS network topologies for real-world architectures.
